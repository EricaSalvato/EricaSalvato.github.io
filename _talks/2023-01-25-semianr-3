Reinforcement learning (RL) offers the chance to make a system learn control policies to successfully and autonomously perform specific tasks. 
Despite its inherent potential as a control technique, RL still has some limitations that affect its effectiveness on real-world dynamic systems. 

In this presentation, we focus on the applications of RL to real-world control problems, both in simulation and in reality.
We also discuss about the *reality gap* (RG), i.e.,the phenomenon, triggered by the difference between the simulator and the real system, which leads to the degradation of the controller performance, learned on a simulator when used on the real system.
