<div style="text-align: justify">
I’m an Assistant Professor (non-tenure track) in Automatic Control at the <a href="https://dia.units.it/">Department of Engineering and Architecture</a> at the <a href="https://www.units.it/">University of Trieste</a>. 
I earned my <a href="https://www.unime.it/it/cds/ingegneria-elettronica-e-informatica">B.Sc. in Information Engineering</a> in 2015 from the University of Messina, Italy, where I worked under the supervision of <a href="https://archivio.unime.it/it/persona/nicola-donato/orario">Prof. Nicola Donato</a>. After that, I completed both my <a href="https://ieuts.units.it/">M.Sc. in Electrical and Control Systems Engineering</a> in 2018 and my <a href="https://portale.units.it/en/research/phd/programmes/industrial-engineering">Ph.D. in Industrial and Information Engineering</a> in 2022 at the University of Trieste, under the guidance of <a href="https://feliceandreapellegrino.github.io/">Prof. Felice Andrea Pellegrino</a>.
In late 2022 I had the opportunity to be a Visiting Researcher at the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/research/">Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering</a> of the Imperial College London, working with <a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/t.parisini">Prof. Thomas Parisini<a/>.

My research mainly focuses on <strong>Data-driven and Learning-based control</strong>, especially in robotics, but I’m also interested in more standard applications of <strong>Control theory</strong> and <strong>Machine learning</strong>.</div>
