Since 2023, I have been an Assistant Professor (non-tenure track) in Automatic Control at the <a href="https://dia.units.it/">Department of Engineering and Architecture</a> at the <a href="https://www.units.it/">University of Trieste</a>. 

  
I received my <a href="https://www.unime.it/it/cds/ingegneria-elettronica-e-informatica">B.Sc. in Information Engineering</a> in 2015 from the University of Messina (Italy), where I was supervised by <a href="https://archivio.unime.it/it/persona/nicola-donato/orario">Prof. Nicola Donato</a>. 


Later, I earned both my <a href="https://ieuts.units.it/">M.Sc. in Electrical and Control Systems Engineering</a> in 2018 and my <a href="https://portale.units.it/en/research/phd/programmes/industrial-engineering">Ph.D. in Industrial and Information Engineering</a> in February 2022 fromn the University of Trieste, under the mentorship of  <a href="https://feliceandreapellegrino.github.io/">Prof. Felice Andrea Pellegrino</a>.


In February 2022 I successfully defended my thesis titled <a href="https://arts.units.it/handle/11368/3010839">Reinforcement Learning for Real World Dynamical Systems: Applications and Limitations</a>, obtaining the Ph.D. degree.


From November 2021 to January 2023, I had the chance to work as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Engineering and Architecture at the University of Trieste. During the same year, I was also a Visiting Researcher at the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/research/">Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering</a> of the Imperial College London, supervised by <a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/t.parisini">Prof. Thomas Parisini</a>.


My research mainly focuses on <strong>Data-driven and Learning-based control</strong>, especially in robotics. Still, Iâ€™m also interested in more standard applications of <strong>Control theory</strong> and <strong>Machine learning</strong>.</div>
