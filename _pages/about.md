I received the B.Sc. degree in Electronic Engineering in 2015 from the [University of Messina](https://www.unime.it/it/cds/ingegneria-elettronica-e-informatica) (Italy) and the M.Sc. degree in Electrical and Control Systems Engineering in 2018 from the [University of Trieste](https://ieuts.units.it/) (Italy). I am currently a PhD student in the [Industrial Automation Lab](https://control.units.it/it/) of the [Department of Engineering and Architecture](https://dia.units.it/) at the [University of Trieste](https://www.units.it/). My research focuses on the application of **Artificial Intelligence** as a systems control tool, but includes also **Control Theory**, **Machine Learning** and **Robotics**.
