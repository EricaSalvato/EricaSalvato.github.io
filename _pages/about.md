<div style="text-align: justify">I am an Assistant Professor (non tenure track) of the <a href="https://dia.units.it/">Department of Engineering and Architecture</a> at the <a href="https://www.units.it/">University of Trieste</a>. I received the <a href="https://www.unime.it/it/cds/ingegneria-elettronica-e-informatica">B.Sc. degree in Electronic Engineering</a> in 2015 from the University of Messina (Italy). Then I moved in Trieste, where I earned my <a href="https://ieuts.units.it/">M.Sc. degree in Electrical and Control Systems Engineering</a> and the Ph.D., respectively in 2018 and 2022, at the University of Trieste (Italy). My research focuses on the use of <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong> as a real-world dynamical systems control tool, but includes also <strong>Control Theory</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Robotics</strong>.</div>
