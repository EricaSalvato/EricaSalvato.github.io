<div style="text-align: right">I am an Assistant Professor (non tenure track) of the [Department of Engineering and Architecture](https://dia.units.it/) at the [University of Trieste](https://www.units.it/). I received the B.Sc. degree in Electronic Engineering in 2015 from the [University of Messina](https://www.unime.it/it/cds/ingegneria-elettronica-e-informatica) (Italy). Then I moved in Trieste, where I earned my M.Sc. degree in Electrical and Control Systems Engineering and the Ph.D., respectively in 2018 and 2022, at the [University of Trieste](https://ieuts.units.it/) (Italy). My research focuses on the use of **Reinforcement Learning** as a real-world dynamical systems control tool, but includes also **Control Theory**, **Machine Learning** and **Robotics**.</div>
