abstract = {This paper proposes a technique to control a cable robot in the total absence of a model and its parameters. The cable robot is actuated by three motors whose data, including exact positions, pulley diameters, and nominal cable length, are unknown. We just assume to have a very rough knowledge of lower and upper bounds for the partial derivatives of the relation between the cable lengths and the end-effector space coordinates. A structured-light sensor measures the end-effector position, and the goal is to drive it to a designated point. An algorithm is proposed with guaranteed convergence based on the so-called model-free plant tuning approach. No learning stage is required. Experimental results are reported.}

	abstract = {Home appliances are nowadays present in every house. In order to ensure a suitable level of maintenance, manufacturers strive to design a method to estimate the wear of the single electrical parts composing an appliance without providing it with a large number of expensive sensors. With this in mind, our goal consists in inferring the status of the electrical actuators of a washing machine, given the measures of electrical signals at the plug, which carry an aggregate information. The approach is end-to-end, i.e. it does not require any feature extraction and thus it can be easily generalized to other appliances. Two different techniques have been investigated: Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memories. These tools are trained and tested on data collected on four different washing machines.},

	abstract = {The optimization of particle accelerators is a challenging task, and many different approaches have been proposed in years, to obtain an optimal tuning of the plant and to keep it optimally tuned despite drifts or disturbances. Indeed, the classical model-free approaches (such as Gradient Ascent or Extremum Seeking algorithms) have intrinsic limitations. To overcome those limitations, Machine Learning techniques, in particular, the Reinforcement Learning, are attracting more and more attention in the particle accelerator community. The purpose of this paper is to apply a Reinforcement Learning model-free approach to the alignment of a seed laser, based on a rather general target function depending on the laser trajectory. The study focuses on the alignment of the lasers at FERMI, the free-electron laser facility at Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste. In particular, we employ Q-learning with linear function approximation and report experimental results obtained in two setups, which are the actual setups where the final application has to be deployed. Despite the simplicity of the approach, we report satisfactory preliminary results, that represent the first step toward a fully automatic procedure for seed laser to the electron beam. Such a superimposition is, at present, performed manually.},

	abstract = {Insulin is a peptide hormone produced by the pancreas to regulate the cells intake of glucose in the blood. Type 1 diabetes compromises this particular capacity of the pancreas. Patients with this disease inject insulin to regulate the level of glucose in the blood, thus reducing the risk of longterm complications. Artificial Pancreas (AP) is a wearable device developed to provide automatic delivery of insuline, allowing a potentially significant improvement in the quality of life of patients. In this paper we apply to the AP a Model Predictive Controller able to generate state trajectories that meet constraints expressed through Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Such a form of constraints is indeed appropriate for the AP, in which some requirements result in hard constraints (absolutely avoid hypoglycaemia) and some other in soft constraints (avoid a prolonged hyperglycaemia). We rely on the BluSTL toolbox, which allows to automatically generate controllers using STL specifications. We perform simulations on two different scenarios: an MPC controller that uses the same constraints as [1] and an MPC-STL controller in both deterministic and adversarial environment (robust control). We show that the soft constraints permitted by STL avoid unnecessary restriction, providing safe trajectories in correspondence of higher disturbance.},
