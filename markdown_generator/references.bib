	abstract = {The attainment of a satisfactory operating point is one of the main problems in the tuning of particle accelerators. These are extremely complex facilities, characterized by the absence of a model that accurately describes their dynamics, and by an often persistent noise which, along with machine drifts, affects their behaviour in unpredictable ways. In this paper, we propose an online iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) approach to tackle this problem on the FERMI free-electron laser of Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste. It consists of a model identification performed by a neural network trained on data collected from the real facility, followed by the application of the iLQR in a Model-Predictive Control fashion. We perform several experiments, training the neural network with increasing amount of data, in order to understand what level of model accuracy is needed to accomplish the task. We empirically show that the online iLQR results, on average, in fewer steps than a simple gradient ascent (GA), and requires a less accurate neural network to achieve the goal.},

In order to ensure a suitable level of maintenance, manufacturers strive to design a method to estimate the wear of the single electrical parts composing an appliance without providing it with a large number of expensive sensors. With this in mind, our goal consists in inferring the status of the electrical actuators of a washing machine, given the measures of electrical signals at the plug, which carry an aggregate information. The approach is end-to-end, i.e. it does not require any feature extraction and thus it can be easily generalized to other appliances. Two different techniques have been investigated: Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memories. These tools are trained and tested on data collected on four different washing machines.},

	journal = {CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS},
	volume = {51},
	abstract = {The glycemia regulation is a significant challenge in the Artificial Pancreas (AP) scenario. Several control systems have been developed in the last years, many of them requiring meal announcements. Therefore, if the patients skip the meal announcement or make a mistake in the estimation of the amount of carbohydrates, the control performance will be negatively affected. In this extended version of our previous work, we present a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for the AP in which the meal is treated as a disturbance to be estimated by an Unknown Input Observer (UIO). The MPC constraints are expressed in terms of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications. Indeed, in the AP some requirements result in hard constraints (in particular, absolutely avoid hypoglycemia and absolutely avoid severe hyperglycemia) and some other in soft constraints (avoid a prolonged hyperglycemia) and STL is suitable for expressing such requirements. The achieved results are obtained using the BluSTL toolbox, which allows to synthesize model predictive controllers with STL constraints. We report simulations showing that the proposed approach, avoiding unnecessary restrictions, provides safe trajectories in correspondence of higher unknown disturbance.},

	abstract = {Estimating the wear of the single electrical parts of a home appliance without resorting to a large number of sensors is
desirable for ensuring a proper level of maintenance by the manufacturers. Deep learning techniques can be effective tools

the actual deployment. In this work, we employ one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term
Memory networks to infer the status of some electrical components of different models of washing machines, from the
electrical signals measured at the plug. These tools are trained and tested on a large dataset (502 washing cycles  1000 h)
collected from four different washing machines and are carefully designed in order to comply with the memory constraints
imposed by available hardware selected for a real implementation. The approach is end-to-end; i.e., it does not require any
feature extraction, except the harmonic decomposition of the electrical signals, and thus it can be easily generalized to
other appliances.},

Indeed, the classical model-free approaches (such as Gradient Ascent or Extremum Seeking algorithms) have intrinsic limitations. To overcome those limitations, Machine Learning techniques, in particular, the Reinforcement Learning, are attracting more and more attention in the particle accelerator community. The purpose of this paper is to apply a Reinforcement Learning model-free approach to the alignment of a seed laser, based on a rather general target function depending on the laser trajectory. The study focuses on the alignment of the lasers at FERMI, the free-electron laser facility at Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste. In particular, we employ Q-learning with linear function approximation and report experimental results obtained in two setups, which are the actual setups where the final application has to be deployed. Despite the simplicity of the approach, we report satisfactory preliminary results, that represent the first step toward a fully automatic procedure for seed laser to the electron beam. Such a superimposition is, at present, performed manually.},

	abstract = {Insulin is a peptide hormone produced by the pancreas to regulate the cells intake of glucose in the blood. Type 1 diabetes compromises this particular capacity of the pancreas. Patients with this disease inject insulin to regulate the level of glucose in the blood, thus reducing the risk of longterm complications. Artificial Pancreas (AP) is a wearable device developed to provide automatic delivery of insuline, allowing a potentially significant improvement in the quality of life of patients. In this paper we apply to the AP a Model Predictive Controller able to generate state trajectories that meet constraints expressed through Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Such a form of constraints is indeed appropriate for the AP, in which some requirements result in hard constraints (absolutely avoid hypoglycaemia) and some other in soft constraints (avoid a prolonged hyperglycaemia). We rely on the BluSTL toolbox, which allows to automatically generate controllers using STL specifications. We perform simulations on two different scenarios: an MPC controller that uses the same constraints as [1] and an MPC-STL controller in both deterministic and adversarial environment (robust control). We show that the soft constraints permitted by STL avoid unnecessary restriction, providing safe trajectories in correspondence of higher disturbance.},
